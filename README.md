# Survival Game

A 2D Survival game, similar to zombie games in the sense that enemies only spawn at night, you start with a set max amount of workers and try to architect your buildings in such a way that provides both, the best looks and highest functionality. Please note it is a work in progress (very early).

The game is ultimately hoping to fill that itch for creativity, engineering, and survival.
